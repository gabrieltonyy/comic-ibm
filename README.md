# IBM TECH TALENT SERIES

## Comic Store - README

### Project Overview
This repository contains the Comic Store, a simple three-page website developed as part of my learning experience in the **IBM Tech Talent Series** frontend design lessons. The project showcases various web design skills that I acquired during the course, such as the use of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for building interactive and accessible web pages.

### Pages
The Comic Store website consists of three main pages:

1. **index.html** (Landing Page):
   - This is the homepage of the Comic Store. It introduces users to the website and provides a brief overview of the types of comics available.
   - Features: 
     - A clean, welcoming design with links to the other pages (Comic Showcase and Contact Page).
     - **CSS Parallax Effect**: Implemented to give the landing page an immersive experience.

2. **comic.html** (Comic Showcase):
   - This page showcases the different types of comics available in the store. Users can browse through a selection of comics.
   - When a user selects a comic, JavaScript is used to redirect them to the relevant comic product page.
   - **JavaScript**: Ensures that users are correctly directed to the comic product pages based on their selection.
   - **Flexbox & Grid Layout**: Applied to create a responsive and well-organized layout for the comic showcase, overcoming the challenges I initially faced with these CSS properties.

3. **contact.html** (Contact Page):
   - This page includes a link to my **LinkedIn profile**, allowing users to connect with me directly.
   - Simple, minimalistic design focused on clear and easy navigation to my LinkedIn.

### Key Features and Lessons Applied
- **CSS Parallax Effect**: Implemented on the landing page to create an engaging user experience.
- **Link Integration**: Hyperlinks are connected to other pages within the site and external sites (e.g., LinkedIn).
- **Web Accessibility**: Strived to meet the web accessibility standards using the **WAVE extension tool**. Adjustments were made to improve usability and ensure the website is accessible to a broader audience.
- **Flexbox and Grid Layouts**: These CSS techniques were used for layout design to make the site responsive across different devices. Despite challenges, I was able to apply these methods for proper alignment and spacing of content.
  
### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gabrieltonyy/comic-ibm.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the landing page.
3. Navigate through the website by using the links to visit the comic showcase (`comic.html`) and the contact page (`contact.html`).

### Future Improvements
- Expand the product pages to include more detailed comic information and images.
- Add a shopping cart and user authentication for a more complete comic store experience.
- Improve design responsiveness and accessibility further, refining based on user feedback and accessibility tests.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid Layout, Parallax Effect)
- **JavaScript**
